# Diacritic Typing Tool: [Betacode](https://schefflaa.github.io/betacode/)

This tool is designed for people who need to type complex diacritical characters, such as œ̣̃́ (`#o1?-~/`).

It facilitates the typing process by allowing these characters to be entered using alternative code.

## Usage
Start by typing `#` followed by the base letter (a-z) and then diacritical marks.

Examples:
- to type á in betacode: `#a/`
- to type ë̄́ in betacode: `#e:-/`
- to type ǭ́ in betacode: `#o4-/`

and so on.

The order to type the diacritics is bottom-up, and it remains consistent regardless of the base letter. 

## Code Reference
Here is a quick reference for some codes and their respective diacritics:

- **Code: `/`** → Acute Accent:  ́
- **Code: `\`** → Grave Accent:  ̀
