# Diacritic Typing Tool: Betacode

This tool is designed for linguists and others who need to type complex diacritical characters, such as œ̣̃́ (`#o1?-~/`).

It facilitates the typing process by allowing these complex characters to be entered using alternative code. 

Start by typing `#` followed by the base letter and diacritical marks. Examples:
- to type á in betacode: `#a/`
- to type ë̄́ in betacode: `#e:-/`
- to type ǭ́ in betacode: `#o4-/`

and so on.

You are welcome to use, extend or modify this tool to suit your needs, but please remember to cite it appropriately in your work 🤝🏼
