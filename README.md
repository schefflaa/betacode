# Diacritic Typing Tool: Betacode

This tool is designed for people who need to type complex diacritical characters, such as œ̣̃́ (`#o1?-~/`).

It facilitates the typing process by allowing these characters to be entered using alternative code. 


## Usage
Start by typing `#` followed by the base letter (a-z) and then diacritical marks.

Examples:
- to type á in betacode: `#a/`
- to type ë̄́ in betacode: `#e:-/`
- to type ǭ́ in betacode: `#o4-/`

and so on.

The order to type the diacritic codes is bottom-up, and it remains consistent regardless of the base letter. 

## Code Reference
Here is a quick reference for the codes and their respective diacritics:

- **Code: `/`** → Acute Accent:  ́
- **Code: `\`** → Grave Accent:  ̀
- **Code: `:`** → Diaeresis:  ̈
- **Code: `-`** → Macron:  ̄
- **Code: `!`** → Breve:  ˘
- **Code: `~`** → Tilde:  ̃
- **Code: `^`** → Caron:  ˇ
- **Code: `^1`** → Circumflex:  ̂
- **Code: `?`** → Dot Below:  ̣
- **Code: `(`** → Cedilla:  ̧
