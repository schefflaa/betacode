# Diacritic Typing Tool (Betacode)

This tool is designed for linguists and others who need to type complex diacritical characters, such as œ̣̃́ (`#o1?-~/`).
It facilitates the typing process by allowing complex combined characters to be entered using alternative code. 

Start by typin `#` followed by the base letter and diacritical marks. Examples:
- To type á in betacode: ´#a/´
- To type ë̄́ in betacode: ´#e:-/´
- and so on.

Feel free to use or modify this tool to suit your needs, but please remember to cite it appropriately in your work.
