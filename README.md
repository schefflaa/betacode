# Diacritic Typing Tool: Betacode

This tool is designed for linguists and others who need to type complex diacritical characters, such as œ̣̃́ (`#o1?-~/`).

It facilitates the typing process by allowing complex combined characters to be entered using alternative code. 

💡 Start by typing `#` followed by the base letter and diacritical marks. Examples:
- to type á in betacode: `#a/`
- to type ë̄́ in betacode: `#e:-/`
- to type ǭ́ in betacode: `ǭ́`

and so on.
